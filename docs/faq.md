**Q: When I enable Pin Mode, the application background becomes transparent. What could be the reason?**

- You might have tried to make another application full screen while WordPocket is pinned.
- Right-click the WordPocket icon in the system tray, choose “Exit,” and restart WordPocket.
- To avoid this issue, we recommend disabling Pin Mode before making other applications full screen.

**Q: I closed the window, but the application is still running. Is this normal?**

- Yes, when you click the X button, the application does not close; it continues running in the background. This is designed so you can access WordPocket instantly from the system tray.
- To completely close the application, right-click the WordPocket icon in the system tray and select “Exit.”

**Q: I can’t see the icon in the system tray. Why could this be?**

- The icon might have been moved to Windows’ hidden icons section. Click the up arrow on the taskbar to check.

**Q: I typed a word, but no translation appeared. What could be the reason?**

- You might have misspelled the word.
- You might have selected the wrong source language.
- Please check your internet connection again.

**Q: Dragging a word from another application doesn’t work. Why?**

- Drag-and-drop is only supported in some applications. The app you are using may not support this feature.

**Q: Automatic language detection does nothing.**

- In this case, the detected language is the same as the currently selected one.
- If you think this is an error, the word’s language may not be among your source languages.

**Q: Automatic language detection picks the wrong language.**

- This can happen with very short words or words common to multiple languages.
- The word’s language might not be in your source language list. Check your source languages.

**Q: I keep having to change the source language. Is there a faster way?**

- Yes, you can use shortcut keys. View or customize them in Settings > Shortcuts.

**Q: I can’t save the translation. Why?**

- The translation box may be empty.
- If you didn’t make any edits before saving, you might be trying to save an empty entry.

**Q: The custom shortcut I set doesn’t work.**

- You may have chosen a shortcut that conflicts with system shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z). Reconfigure it in the Settings menu.

**Q: I exported the dictionary as a PDF, but the words don’t show or appear as black boxes.**

- First, ensure that the fields appearing as blank actually contain words.
- If you’re sure, this means there’s an issue with the font for that language. Contact us with details about the problematic language.
