Is this normal?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, when you click the X button, the application does not close; it continues running in the background. This is designed so you can access Wordpocket instantly from the system tray.</li> <li>To completely close the application, right-click the Wordpocket icon in the system tray and select \u201cExit.\u201d</li> </ul> <p>Q: I can\u2019t see the icon in the system tray. Why could this be?</p> <ul> <li>The icon might have been moved to Windows\u2019 hidden icons section. Click the up arrow on the taskbar to check.</li> </ul> <p>Q: I typed a word, but no translation appeared. What could be the reason?</p> <ul> <li>You might have misspelled the word.</li> <li>You might have selected the wrong source language.</li> <li>Please check your internet connection again.</li> </ul> <p>Q: Dragging a word from another application doesn\u2019t work. Why?</p> <ul> <li>Drag-and-drop is only supported in some applications. The app you are using may not support this feature.</li> </ul> <p>Q: Automatic language detection does nothing.</p> <ul> <li>In this case, the detected language is the same as the currently selected one.</li> <li>If you think this is an error, the word\u2019s language may not be among your source languages.</li> </ul> <p>Q: Automatic language detection picks the wrong language.</p> <ul> <li>This can happen with very short words or words common to multiple languages.</li> <li>The word\u2019s language might not be in your source language list. Check your source languages.</li> </ul> <p>Q: I keep having to change the source language. Is there a faster way?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, you can use shortcut keys. View or customize them in Settings &gt; Shortcuts.</li> </ul> <p>Q: I can\u2019t save the translation. Why?</p> <ul> <li>The translation box may be empty.</li> <li>If you didn\u2019t make any edits before saving, you might be trying to save an empty entry.</li> </ul> <p>Q: The custom shortcut I set doesn\u2019t work.</p> <ul> <li>You may have chosen a shortcut that conflicts with system shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z). Reconfigure it in the Settings menu.</li> </ul> <p>Q: I exported the dictionary as a PDF, but the words don\u2019t show or appear as black boxes.</p> <ul> <li>First, ensure that the fields appearing as blank actually contain words.</li> <li>If you\u2019re sure, this means there\u2019s an issue with the font for that language.
